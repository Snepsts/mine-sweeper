# Minesweeper
### by Stephen Sladek

This is my attempt at creating the classic game Minesweeper. It is developed using 2 2D arrays, one for holding the player's interface, and the other for the underlying mines. In order to play, the player will simply enter the (x,y) coordinates of the block they would like to select.
